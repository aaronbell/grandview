# Grandview
Grandview is a sans serif typeface derived from the [DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Institut_f%C3%BCr_Normung) standard for German road and railway signage, which was optimized to be highly legible at distance and under poor conditions. It was built based on the existing Bahnschrift font, but optimized more for body text at small sizes with the same high quality legibility. 

Grandview is one of five new fonts being considered as a [replacement for Calibri](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/04/28/beyond-calibri-finding-microsofts-next-default-font/). Thank you all for your support and comments!

As we move forward with the competition, there will be an opportunity to improve Grandview and make it work even better than it does today. To that extent, this repository will serve as a central location to provide feedback and discuss anything related to Grandview.
